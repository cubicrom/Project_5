Research of an advertising campaign

We are a marketing analyst of the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment application. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the last few months. Your task is to understand the reasons and help the company to become a plus.

There is data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:

server log with data about their visits,
unloading of their purchases for this period,
advertising expenses.

We have to study:

where do users come from and what devices they use,
how much does it cost to attract users from various advertising channels;
how much money each client brings,
when the costs of attracting a client pay off,
what factors prevent attracting customers.
